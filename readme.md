## What am I doing?
Glad you asked. I get bored. Often when I get bored I want to code but I really suck at coming up with my own ideas sometimes. So I decided "let's see how fast I can get through a beginning code tutorial while still not hating my finished projects".

[FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) is a newer kid on the block but they have a *lot* of challenges. So sure, let's do this. I'll mostly be working on this during the weekend. They has a bunch of challenges that live on their site but I'll only be posting the big projects that are actual web apps here.

Projects live on Heroku [here](http://lindseythegeek.herokuapp.com).
